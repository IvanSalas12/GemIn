# GemIn
Custom skills and commands to supercharge your Gemini CLI experience.

So, I noticed that a lot of peopl nowadays uses ClaudeCode or Opencode, since they are honestly great tools.
Nevetheless, i also know that a not so little amount of people uses GeminiCLI, but the tools made are mostly taking in considereation other tools that are not part of the Google ecosistem.
This Repository takes SKILLS.md files that are found in other repositories, and adapts themto the current Gemini Workflow, making them more "native" to this partcular TUI.

Also, it has some of my own collection, so its heavily thought out to be used alongside web developers
